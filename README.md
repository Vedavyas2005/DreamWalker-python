## 🌙 DreamWalker — Turn Your Dreams Into Cinematic Stories

DreamWalker is an AI-powered dream interpretation and storytelling app built with Streamlit and Google’s latest Gemini API. It lets you describe any dream you’ve had — no matter how strange or abstract — and instantly transforms it into a symbolic psychological analysis and a cinematic short story.

This isn’t just text generation — DreamWalker tries to decode the deeper meaning behind your dreams and then weave them into stories that feel poetic, mythic, or even dark and mysterious — just the way you want them.

## 🧪 How It Works

Describe your dream in plain English.

Choose a storytelling tone (optional).

DreamWalker first interprets your dream symbolically and then writes a cinematic story inspired by it.

You can continue the story, restyle it, or download it as a text file.

## 💭 Inspiration

DreamWalker was built around a simple idea: our dreams are stories trying to speak to us. This project lets AI act as an ancient dream-teller — interpreting, expanding, and narrating our inner worlds into something we can read, reflect on, and share.
